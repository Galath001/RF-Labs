Simulation started on: Mon Oct 14 15:27:51 2019
Simulation Mode: RF
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout is electrically large above 7.35 GHz (space wave radiation)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Substrate is electrically large above 40.7 GHz (surface wave radiation)
RF simulation can be less accurate as it ignores radiation
Consider:  - lowering the maximum frequency
           - simulating in MW mode
